# groupVideo_calling_screen_sharingapp-final
I try to implement video call and screenshare using agora and i successfully built it but problem are that 
1--> user have to turn off camera to screenshare ok that means user can only remain in videocall not both( videocall  + share screen )ok  and
2-->  whenever user leave or stop screenshare  there is error like user is no longer, screenshare disconnected thus i havenot implemented messages for those and also not implementing error handling 
3--> whenever i turnoff camera it is only off to himself not to other user who are in videocall that means other user are seeing him haha 
4--> in the case of mic i feel its nothing work coz i have been only listening echo hahahahahahahhaa




then what sadan subedi built ? 
answer is i built only videocall features and screenshare feature thats it ok 
 AT THE END
